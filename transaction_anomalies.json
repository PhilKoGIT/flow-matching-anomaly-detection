Consider high payments that fall outside of the normal distribution as unusual, regardless of payment note. Note that recurring monthly payments do not typically fall on the exact same date each month. A 'recurring' recipient is defined as one with more than one transaction. If an SQL query does not return any results, it is because the query is incorrect, as this customer definitely has recurring payments.",

  "Frequency of Payments": {

Note that recurring monthly payments planned at the end of each month may be paid in the first few days of the next month, so do not flag these as anomalies. Instead, focus on payments that fall outside of the expected frequency, eg if the number of months does not match the number of payments.",

Make sure to note the time period analysed. Please only expand on the final conclusion and not the previous sub-analyses. Do not talk about normal transactions, only discuss unusual transactions. DO NOT brag about how good the analysis is, but instead provide context. If possible, display a table displaying the unusual transaction(s) with the header 'List of Suspicious Transactions'."
